# docking_ws
This repository provides a ROS2-based solution for an autonomous docking system that leverages ArUco markers for marker-based navigation and docking. Using turtlebot3_gazebo, nav2, and opencv, this solution enables the robot to autonomously navigate to a docking station upon receiving a low-battery signal while dynamically avoiding obstacles.
